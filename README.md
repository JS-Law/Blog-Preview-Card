## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

### What I learned

I learned the value of mobile first development. I and continually taken aback by how dramatically different and wildly easier it feels to develop for mobile viewports first.

Prior, I would dread the creation of new viewports because that meant I would have to dramatically change many CSS rules and even document flow. Now I can make a few adjustments, test and push my final commit!

I also learned the value of `object-fit:`, I was REALLY scratching my head once I realized the blog image wasnt the height I needed! After a bit of research and some implementation, I was able to get the functionality that I required.

### Continued development

I will continue to use the mobile first workflow and try to recognize more opportunities to use `object-fit:` in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSSMatic](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - CSSMatic has helped me a ton during my development, I always use it for box-shadows and its easy to use.

## Acknowledgments

I have to give a shoutout to the Frontend Mentor team. I truly dont know where I would have achieved the same success on my path if not for the discovery of this community. Theres so many things I could say in gratitude of the platform but to be succinct, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with high quality design files and clearly communicated projects.
